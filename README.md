<h2>INDIVIDUAL PROJECT II DATA 08 -- Analysis of Data Dashboard <br><br>

<br>
**Proposal to answer**
<br>
"We will simulate a situation where a company seeking to invest in the stock market asks you to analyze it in detail. Considering that the company is not familiar with this financial area, it requests an explanation of what has happened in this market in recent years (considering positive and negative impacts from the year 2000), investment recommendations (whether focused on companies or areas of these) and other complementary information that, as a data expert, you are able to provide."

<br>
**Repository files:**
<br>
*EDA: In it we collect, visualize the data, export to csv and evaluate certain important factors to discard or maintain the asset as part of the final recommendation.
<br>
*Dashboard: Clearer visualization and contrasting assets in the selected period of time, supporting the final decision.
<br>
<br>
<br>
**Final evaluation:**
<br>
Post pandemic we observe a response, supposedly clear from the stock market, where two sectors included within stand out [S&P500](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anexo:Compa%C3%B1%C3%ADas_del_S%26P_500), the recreational consumer sector with its rising value and the energy sector with a theoretical downward trend, but reviewing the data of the TOP companies in both sectors more deeply, a correction can be observed to these supposed trends that were only driven by the years of pandemic, reaching its ceiling at the beginning of 2023 and thus correcting its market value at this time.
<br>
Likewise, we accompany the favorable forecast in favor of the energy sector, relying on the information obtained from international organizations that regulate this sector (SEE SOURCES AT THE END OF THE FILE), thus making the forecast even more favorable for companies that generate electricity based on of coal, consume oil or gas, versus, and taking into account the period to be evaluated (2000 - 2023) where the closure of the most direct competition of this type of company (nuclear energy) is promoted worldwide, thus leaving the energy market, free of all kinds of competition and with a more than favorable forecast, mainly for the companies observed in the analysis.
